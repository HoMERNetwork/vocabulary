It could be a real movie theatre, a theatre, a cinema-theatre, a multipurpose venue, a building used for something else (e.g. hospital), an open-air cinema, etc. It is an address, usually, and correspond to specific geographic coordinates. The building, the management, the architecture, the name, etc., all can change, but it stays the same 'sala cinematografica' as long as it shows movies. Travelling cinemas are exluded for now.
