It does not matter whether this was on a regular basis or not. Also a cinema can be an open air space (not a building) where a film is screened. This can be a square, a courtyard, a field. #2: A cinema operation that was active at a certain period, run by a specific person or company (both in buildings called cinema theatres, see below, or at temporary events, as in the case of travelling cinemas) #3: A cinema (biograf, in Swedish) is the venue, that has been listed by film companies (also known as 'cinemas' in the Swedish industry records, ie Filmägarnas kontrollbyrå) for more or less regular exhibition of film. It is a geographically fixed (with a street address) building. The frequency of film exhibition in a cinema varies from once every other month to 14 screenings a week (or more). Cinema can be one function of many in a multipurpose venue or a stand-alone purpose-built venue. Cinema can be owned by the organisation or company that owns the venue or it can be a company who rents the venue (multi-purpose of stand-alone) for exhibition.

Single-purpose or multi-purpose venues, commercial, parish, afterwork and recreational cinemas are all included.

In Spanish Cines, Salas de Cine o Teatros #12 Buildings expressly devoted to the screening of films (although allowing also for occasional live events, like music, plays, vaudeville, bingo, etc., either as part of the programming of films or in independent programming). When buildings were originally devoted to live theatre plays, concerts, opera, vaudeville, etc. and they alternated with film screenings, we use the word \"theatre\" (in Latin America the word \"teatro\" is mostly used for live entertainment events and \"cine\" for film screenings, unlike American English which tend to use \"theatre\" also for movie venues. In our work, when we refer to humble neighborhood cinema places with no roof, we tend to qualify the description, saying \"open-air cinemas\" or \"terrazas.\" DOI:
