# HoMER Vocabulary of Moviegoing

The goal of the HoMER Vocabulary of Moviegoing project is to create a shared vocabulary which will enable searching and comparing the information about moviegoing, exhibition and reception stored in different datasets and research projects. In the future this should also allow us to link data stored in different online datasets, and to make research of the HoMER community more visible. Additionally, it would be very useful to have a shared vocabulary for future projects, that facilitates cross-dataset collaboration.

Through a series of surveys we are gradually building this vocabulary. We use this repository to share the results of the surveys and to discuss the vocabulary.
